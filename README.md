# Secret Number Compare

A simple, privacy-focused web tool for two people to compare numbers without revealing them to each other.  
Built for GitHub Pages â€” just open the site in your browser!

## How it works

- Two players each enter their secret number (inputs are hidden as you type).
- Click "Compare" to reveal only the result:  
  - **Player 1 wins!**
  - **Player 2 wins!**
  - **It's a tie!**
- The actual numbers are never displayed on screen.

## Usage

1. Open the site ([your GitHub Pages URL here, e.g.](https://krishynan.github.io/secret-number-compare/))
2. Player 1 enters their number in the first field (keep it secret!)
3. Player 2 enters their number in the second field (keep it secret!)
4. Click "Compare" to see who wins.
5. Click "Start Over" to play again.

## How to deploy

1. [Create a new public GitHub repository](https://github.com/new)
2. Copy these files into your repository:
    - `index.html`
    - `style.css`
    - `app.js`
    - `README.md`
3. Commit and push.
4. In your repo, go to **Settings > Pages** and set your source to the default branch (usually `main`) and root directory.
5. Visit your site at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/`
